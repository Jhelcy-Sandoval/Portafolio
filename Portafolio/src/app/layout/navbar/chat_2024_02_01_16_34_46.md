The provided code seems to have some syntax errors and logical issues. Let's go through it step by step:

1. The function declaration seems incorrect. It should start with the "function" keyword. Assuming you want to define it as a method of an object, it should be something like this:

```javascript
isCollapse() {
  // Code goes here
}
```

2. Inside the if statement, there is an assignment using a single equals sign (`=`) instead of a comparison using triple equals (`===`). To compare the values of `this.collapse` and `this.collapse ? true : false`, you need to use `===` like this:

```javascript
if (this.collapse === (this.collapse ? true : false)) {
  // Code goes here
}
```

3. The line `this.collapse === true || false` is not necessary, as it doesn't have any effect on the behavior of the code. You can omit it.

4. Finally, the `console.log` statement can remain as it is for debugging purposes.

Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
isCollapse() {
  if (this.collapse === (this.collapse ? true : false)) {
    // Code goes here
  }
  console.log(this.collapse, this.menu);
}
```

However, please note that without further context or explanation of what you are trying to achieve, it is difficult to provide a specific solution or suggest improvements to the code.
